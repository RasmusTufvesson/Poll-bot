# Poll bot

This is a discord bot that can generate polls and tally said polls. I have made this bot specifically for one discord server and thus it doesnt really have that much customizability.

## How to use

When you first launch the bot it will create two files for storing data and ask for some information on how to configure the bot.


To generate a poll simply do `/poll` and fill out the details.


To tally up results right click on the poll message and then click `Apps > Tally`.


Only authorized users can use these commands. To authorize another user do `/add_allowed` and then choose the user.
